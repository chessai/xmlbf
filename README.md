# xmlbf

_XML back and forth!_

`xmlbf` provides `FromXML` and `ToXML` instances intended to be used as the
familiar `FromJSON` and `ToJSON` from the `aeson` package.

Build by running `nix-build` in the top-level directory. Alternatively, running
`nix-shell` in the top-level directory puts you in a shell where all of the
dependencies of this project are available. There you can use `cabal` and/or
`./Setup.hs` as usual.
